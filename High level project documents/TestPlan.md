## Testing Plan

### Easy

- **Cart Management:**
  - Test the "Remove one" button to ensure it removes one book from the cart.
  - Test the "Add one" button to verify it adds one book to the cart.
  - Test the "Remove all" button to confirm it clears all books from the cart.
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Test the search bar to verify search results by title, author, or genre.
- **Authentication:**
  - Test login functionality to ensure successful login.
  - Test sign-up functionality to verify successful account creation.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Test error handling mechanisms for login and sign-up processes with various error scenarios (e.g., incorrect password, duplicate email).

### Medium

- **Checkout Process:**
  - Test if the information provided in the checkout form accurately reflects on the receipt page.
  - Test various scenarios with card number input to validate correct handling of valid and invalid inputs.
- **Cart Interaction:**
  - Test if the "add to cart" button properly adds the selected book to the cart.

### Hard

- **Inventory and Display:**
  - Test the functionality of the inventory filter to ensure accurate filtering of books.
  - Automate tests to verify that book covers are displayed correctly using a cover tester.

### Integration and Automation

- **Selenium Testing:**
  - Automate tests for login, sign-up, adding to cart, and checkout processes using Selenium.
  - Test if the information provided in the checkout form accurately reflects on the receipt page.
  - Test various scenarios with card number input to validate correct handling of valid and invalid inputs.
  - Test if the "add to cart" button properly adds the selected book to the cart.
  - Test the functionality of the inventory filter to ensure accurate filtering of books.
  - Automate tests to verify that book covers are displayed correctly using a cover tester.
- **Coverage Enhancement:**
  - Extend automation coverage to include critical paths and regression test cases.
- **Data Management:**
  - Implement test data management strategy to cover various scenarios (e.g., different user profiles, book categories).

### Usability

- **Usability Testing:**
  - Test the user interface for ease of use, intuitive navigation, and responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### Performance and Scalability

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Conduct performance tests to ensure system responsiveness under load conditions.
- **Scalability Testing:**
  - Test the system's ability to handle increasing loads and transactions without degradation in performance.
